# Hybrid-GraphRAG-Based-System-for-Question-Answering-on-Type-2-Diabetes  

This project explores the use of knowledge graphs and Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) techniques to build an intelligent assistant capable of answering domain-specific questions more effectively. The goal is to combine structured knowledge with language models to improve accuracy and reliability in responses.  

## Project Content  
The notebooks illustrate the main techniques and implementations explored during the project, including:  

- **Data collection**  
- **Knowledge extraction and graph construction**  
- **Vector embeddings**  
- **QA system building**: including different retriever approaches, answer generation, and a Gradio interface  
- **Evaluation experiments**  

## What was done
- Collected and prepared the data  
- Extracted knowledge and built a knowledge graph  
- Generated vector embeddings for retrieval  
- Designed and tested multiple retriever approaches  
- Built a QA pipeline with answer generation and a Gradio interface  
- Conducted evaluation experiments and analyzed results
