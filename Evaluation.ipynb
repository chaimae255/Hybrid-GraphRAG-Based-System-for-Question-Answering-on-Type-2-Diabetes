National diabetes prevention programs in countries like Finland and China have shown that focusing on lifestyle modification, including diet, can contribute to reducing diabetes risk.\\n\\n2. **Regular Physical Activity**: Engaging in regular physical activity is another critical aspect of T2D prevention. Increased levels of physical activity, combined with energy-restricted diets, are recommended for preventing obesity and T2D. Programs that promote behaviors such as exercise have been effective in helping individuals sustain healthy lifestyle changes, thereby attenuating the incidence of diabetes.\\n\\n3. **Managing Risk Factors and Monitoring Health**: Controlling blood sugar levels, managing risk factors such as blood pressure and lipid levels, and monitoring for the development of complications are also vital. While the textual context does not explicitly mention vitamin D supplementation as a prevention method, research into its effects on insulin resistance and potential role in T2D prevention is ongoing. However, current clinical guidelines primarily emphasize lifestyle modifications, including diet and physical activity, as the cornerstone of T2D prevention.\",\n",

    "            \"reference_answer\": \" Type 2 diabetes is high blood sugar levels caused by a lack of a hormone called insulin. Either your body isn't making enough or the insulin it makes doesn't work properly. This is sometimes called insulin resistance.  \\nLack of insulin causes glucose from what you eat or drink to build up in your blood. So you may get symptoms of type 2 diabetes.  \\nIf you have enough insulin or it is working properly, the glucose in your blood should be released into your cells to give you energy.  \\nIf you do not have enough insulin - or the insulin your body produces is not working properly — the glucose in your blood cannot enter your cells and give you energy. And your blood sugar levels keep rising.  \\nThe main causes of type 2 diabetes are: \\n-\\tLiving with obesity or overweight.  \\n-\\tYour waist measurement is unhealthy for your gender or ethnicity  \\n-\\tToo much fat stored in or around your liver and pancreas – which can affect people of a healthy weight as well as people living with obesity or overweight.   \\n-\\tOther factors that put you at greater risk of developing type 2 diabetes include high blood pressure, age, ethnicity and family history. We call them the risk factors of type 2 diabetes. \\nSome of these are things you can't change, like your age (your risk goes up as you get older), your ethnicity (people from African Caribbean, Black African or South Asian backgrounds are at higher risk – and from a younger age), and if family members have type 2 diabetes. But there are some risk factors that you may be able to change, like your weight or waist size. \\nIf you live with obesity or overweight, it's harder for your body to manage the levels of sugar in your blood, and having a high waist measurement means you're more at risk of insulin resistance. Our research has linked type 2 diabetes with fat surrounding the liver and pancreas. \\nNot being active for most of the day is also a risk factor.
